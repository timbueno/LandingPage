Recently, folks have been sharing their default apps in a bunch of different categories. (I'm told the podcast [Hemispheric Views](https://hemisphericviews.com/) started this. I plan on listening soon.)

I'm a sucker for learning about other people's workflows and seeing how I can make better use of my time, so this was right up my alley.

In recent years I have drastically simplified the amount of third party apps I use. I felt like I was on a hamster wheel of finding and using the latest mail client, RSS reader, to-do list, etc. 

I still keep my ear to the ground about the hot new productivity app but I have to be really sure it’s sticking around before I swap away from the default Apple option. Apple’s apps don’t always have the latest flashy features but I generally expect them to be around for the next five years.

Without further adieu, here are my default apps:

📨 Mail Client
* Apple Mail
  
📮 Mail Server
* GSuite (Is it still called this? I’m considering switching to FastMail but haven’t pulled the trigger yet.)
 
📝 Notes
* Apple Notes

✅ To-Do
* Apple Reminders
 
📷 iPhone Photo Shooting
* Apple Camera
 
🟦 Photo Management
* iCloud Photos / Apple Photos

📆 Calendar
* Fantastical
 
📁 Cloud File Storage
* iCloud Drive
 
📖 RSS
* N/A (I used Feedbin after the death of Google Reader but I no longer use RSS much at all anymore.)
 
🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts
* Apple Contacts
 
🌐 Browser
* Safari / Firefox / Chrome in that order.

💬 Chat
* Apple Messages and one Slack
 
🔖 Bookmarks
* N/A (I usually save links in Apple Reminders or Apple Notes, depending on the context.)
 
📑 Read It Later
* [Ephemera](https://deadpan.io/ephemera) (This one is my app. It’s simple and unique. Check it out!)
 
📜 Word Processing
* Apple Notes / TextEdit / Pages
 
📈 Spreadsheets
* Numbers (I would use Excel in a heartbeat if I had any services spreadsheeting to do.)
 
📊 Presentations
* N/A
 
🛒 Shopping Lists
* Apple Reminders
 
🍴 Meal Planning
* Mela
 
💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance
* Copilot (I’m not convinced this is the app for me. It’s pretty but the Fidelity integration does not work. I’m fielding suggestions. Let me know!)
 
📰 News
* Apple News
 
🎵 Music
* Apple Music
 
🎤 Podcasts
* Overcast
 
🔐 Password Management
* 1Password (Thinking about switching to the native keychain implementation, but I’ve got my family on the 1Password family plan and it sounds like a pain in the butt for me to switch.)
