I have struggled to post anything to the blog this past month. I have been trying to update my app [Bound](https://deadpan.io/bound/) due to new Google Drive API changes and the conversations with Google have been incredibly slow and boring. In the mean time, I have been filling my time by playing a few games and rewatching the Lord of the Rings trilogy with some friends.

Other than that, here is what I did in the past month:

**📺 [The Crown (Season 6)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)).** The final episode of The Crown really nailed the tone. Seeing the queen grapple with her station and humanity against her past selves (and actors) was really well done. I didn’t love every episode this season but the finale made it all worth it. (👍🏻)

**🍿 [Saltburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltburn_(film)).** Didn’t expect this to go the way it did. Not sure I liked it but I didn’t _not_ like it either. If you’re curious, give it a go. 

**📖 [The Narrow Road Between Desires](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/157265081) by Patrick Rothfuss.** Will the third installment in The Kingkiller Chronicles series ever come out? Not sure. This was a fun quick romp in that world and would be a decent onboarding for anyone who was thinking about diving in.  

**🍿 [Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Dial_of_Destiny).** Better and worse than I expected at the same time. Phoebe Waller Bridge was great as usual and so was Ford. The third act was a little over the top for my taste.

**📺 [What If… (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...%3F_(TV_series)).** Entertaining yet forgettable. That pretty much describes the entire post-Endgame Marvel universe for me. Will the pendulum swing back? Not sure, but I think onboarding the X-men (someday) can do it.

**🍿 [Killers of the Flower Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)).** Such a long movie. It's good, as most Scorsese movies are but I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon.

**📺 [Monarch: Legacy of Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch:_Legacy_of_Monsters).** Was this show good? I'm not even sure I enjoyed it. I watched the whole thing because I was on a bit of a Godzilla kick after Godzilla: Minus One but I'm not sure I should have stuck with it.

**📺 [Reacher (Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reacher_(TV_series)).** This show is exactly what you think it is and it's more fun and well done than you would expect. 

**📺 [The Curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_(American_TV_series)).** Very odd show with a finale that shouldn't be missed. Emma Stone, Nathan Fielder, and Ben Safdie were perfect in their roles. Every scene was uncomfortable. I could only watch one episode at a time because it was too exhausting. (👍🏻)

**📺 [Delicious in Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_in_Dungeon).** I always keep a charming anime around to fill the random bits of time. Right now it's Delicious in Dungeon; an anime about eating monsters in a vaguely DnD like world. Every episode there is a new monster to eat. Strange and fun at the same time.

**🕹️ [Midnight Suns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel%27s_Midnight_Suns).** I received a [Backbone One](https://playbackbone.com/products/backbone-one/) as a gift for Christmas last month. I've been playing Midnight Suns via Xbox Remote Play on my iPhone. It's been a pretty fun experience playing a AAA title on my phone. The game is a mix between Slay the Spire and Fire Emblem: Three Houses and it's got me hooked. (👍🏻)
