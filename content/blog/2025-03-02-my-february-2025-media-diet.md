I’m doing a pretty good job of keeping myself distracted from… well, everything, I guess. But it’s hard when the state of the world manages to seep into every conversation, social media feed, and news post. I injured my left foot this month doing something fairly routine (and appropriately embarrassing) and I'm slowly recovering from that. It's given me a lot of time to sit on the couch and watch some mediocre stuff! 

Here's the extremely mediocre list of things I watched and played last month:

🍿 **[Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_%28film%29).** I quite enjoyed this John Wick-style Bollywood action thriller. If you like beat-em-ups, check this out.

🍿 **[Presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_%282024_film%29).** Saw this in theaters and was a tad let down. I wanted this to be a bit spooky and it just wasn't. I did enjoy the first-person perspective and the small ending twist.

🍿 **[Wolf Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Man_%282025_film%29).** Complete garbage and was so dark I almost could not make out what was happening on my TV.

🍿 **[The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher:_Sirens_of_the_Deep).** _The Little Mermaid_ with a lot more bloodshed. I didn't hate this. A decent enough afternoon watch.

🍿 **[Venom: The Last Dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_The_Last_Dance).** I'm not sure why I watched all three of these movies. They're not good.

🍿 **[Paddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_%28film%29) and [Paddington 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_2).** We rewatched these in preparation for the third film. Paddington 2 is an absolute gem of a movie and I'm sure we'll watch it again at some point. (👍)

🍿 **[Paddington In Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_in_Peru).** A fitting third installment, even if it doesn't quite live up to the first two. The recasting of Sally Hawkins was a big miss though.

📺 **[Severance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_%28TV_series%29).** I enjoy this show despite it revealing almost nothing about the larger mystery each episode. I think I like the vibes more than I like the actual story.

📺 **[Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieren:_Beyond_Journey%27s_End).** Love, love, love this anime. I am waiting with bated breath for the next season. The concept is great and Frieren and co.'s deadpan delivery of nearly every line is exactly my cup of tea. Best thing I watched all month. (👍)

📺 **[Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Friendly_Neighborhood_Spider-Man).** Surprised by how much I liked this. The story was more adult than I expected and the twists on the typical Spider-Man formula have been interesting.

📖 **[Oathbringer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oathbringer) by Brandon Sanderson.** This took me exactly forever to finish, despite enjoying every page of it. Looking forward to the rest of the installments. However, I think I'll take a bit of a break before diving into the next one. (👍)

📺 **[The White Lotus (Season 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Lotus).** The first episode didn't do it for me, but the second pulled me back in. Let's see where this goes. I do enjoy an anthology-style show so even if this season doesn't hit, I'll be back for more.

📺 **[Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood).** I tried watching this show a few times but the first few episodes never took. I dived in for maybe the third time and I'm glad I did. The story paid off and the character development was perfectly paced. (👍)

📺 **[Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invincible_%28TV_series%29).** I wish they dropped this show all at once instead of over a few weeks. It's entertaining for sure but a bit of a drag across the month and a half it releases in.

📺 **[Reacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reacher_%28TV_series%29).** He's back and kicking even more ass than ever before. This show is fun even if it feels like it's made for network television with added swear words.

🕹️ **[Spider-Man: Remastered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_(2018_video_game)).** After beating Metaphor: Refantazio I needed something faster-paced and more action-oriented. I'm playing this via streaming on [Boosteroid](https://boosteroid.com/) and have been impressed by the performance. It's even got me thinking about building my own gaming PC, and I never thought I'd say that.
