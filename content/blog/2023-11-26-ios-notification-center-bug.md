When I started this blog, my intention was to resist the urge to use it as an outlet for complaining. The tech commentator world is full enough of that already and I donâ€™t need another space to vent. 

BUT. Iâ€™ve got a bone to pick with one specific iOS bug thatâ€™s bothered me for years and yet Iâ€™ve never seen anyone else mention it:

When Notification Center presents itself, notifications are briefly shown with square corners before re-rendering with rounded corners. 

This issue has happened daily for over a year now and through multiple major iOS updates.

Has anyone else experienced this with the same frequency as me? Whatâ€™s your pet bug that kills you inside?

Someone send help. ðŸ˜…
