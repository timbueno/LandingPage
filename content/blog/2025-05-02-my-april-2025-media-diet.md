This past month flew by, and honestly, I don’t feel like I accomplished all that much! I’ve been playing a few video games in my downtime and continuing to refine my gaming PC/Odin 2 Portal streaming setup.

Here’s what I got up to:

📺 **[Dimension 20: Titan Takedown](https://dimension20.fandom.com/wiki/Titan_Takedown)**.  I’m not a WWE fan, but I am a big fan of Brennan Lee Mulligan. This season was short but very fun! I loved how impressed the cast was with Brennan’s dungeon master skills.

📺 **[The Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Studio_%28TV_series%29)**.  This is my new favorite show. Every episode is a banger—tight 30-minute runtime, gorgeous cinematography, hilarious and a little stressful. Almost every episode features Rogan taking a slapstick fall that has me dying. 👍

📺 **[Devil May Cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_May_Cry_%28TV_series%29)**.  Fun and stylish, but ultimately kind of forgettable.

🍿 **[Mufasa: The Lion King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufasa%3A_The_Lion_King)**.  Too generic, too serious, and the songs were lame. This ain’t it, Disney.

🍿 **[Black Bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bag_%28film%29)**.  Steven Soderbergh nailed the vibes and pacing of this spy thriller. If you’re into the genre, don’t skip this one. 👍

🍿 **[The Monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey_%28film%29)**.  Very rarely do I call a movie garbage. This is garbage.

📺 **[David Blaine: Do Not Attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blaine)**.  I love magic and I love David Blaine. This has a bit of an Anthony Bourdain vibe, and it mostly works.

📺 **[Zenshu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenshu_%28TV_series%29)**.  Taking this one slow, but the animation is top notch. I wish there were more variety in the climaxes of each episode, but it’s still a fun watch.

🕹️ **[Yakuza: Like a Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza%3A_Like_a_Dragon)**.  This game is wild and so much fun. I expected nothing from the story—and I was completely wrong. I’ll definitely be checking out more of the series. 👍

🕹️ **[Kirby's Dream Land 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land_2)**.  I played and beat this entirely on the subway using the [TrimUI Brick](https://trimui.net/collections/trimui-brick). I found a ROM hack that adds Game Boy Color colors, and it made the experience even better. Love me some Kirby. 👍

📺 **[Hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacks_%28TV_series%29)**.  Still fun and still funny. I think it leans a bit too hard into the boomer vs. millennial dynamic, but overall it’s solid. I hope this is the last—or second-to-last—season. It deserves a strong finish.

🍿 **[Heart Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Eyes)**.  Surprisingly good?! It’s a riff on the Scream movies, but honestly works better than recent entries in that franchise. Finding out the director is part of the Make Some Noise crew made me like it even more.

🍿 **[Mickey 17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_17)**.  I loved the book and I love Bong Joon Ho, but I wanted this to be better.

🍿 **[The Woman in the Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_in_the_Yard)**.  Not that great. Some spooky moments, but it’s kind of all downhill from there.

📺 **[The Last of Us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us_%28TV_series%29)**.  I was worried this season wouldn’t live up to the first, but it’s come out swinging. I’ve looked forward to each episode. The second one had some of the best zombie content in years.

🍿 **[Sinners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_(2025_film))**.  A stylish vampire flick from Ryan Coogler? Yes, please. More original blockbusters like this! 👍

🍿 **[Prince of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Darkness_%28film%29)**.  I’m slowly working through John Carpenter’s catalog. This one was strange, but I kind of liked it? It suffers a bit from “dumb horror victim” syndrome, but I loved the mix of science and Christianity.

🕹️ **[The Invincible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invincible_%28video_game%29)**.  An adaptation of a Stanisław Lem book I haven’t read, but it captures the right vibes based on his other work. It’s a walking sim, so you’re mostly here for the story—and it kept me interested the whole way through.

🕹️ **[Tetris: Rosy Retrospection](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/5813/)**.  A ROM hack of the original Game Boy Tetris that improves on the classic. I’m surprised how much I’ve improved since picking it up.

🍿 **[Event Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_%28film%29)**. This movie gets mixed reviews, and yeah—it doesn’t totally make sense. But it’s a blast and feels straight out of the post-Jurassic Park 1990s. I had fun.
