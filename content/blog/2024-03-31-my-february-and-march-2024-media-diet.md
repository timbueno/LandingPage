Well this blog is starting to rot on the vine isn't it? 

Early this month, I decided to follow along with Reactor Mag's Science Fiction Film Club. So far I have watched **🍿 [Forbidden Planet (1956)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Planet)**, **🍿 [Solaris (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1972_film))**, and **🍿 [Silent Running (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running)**. It's been fun experiencing these Sci-Fi classics and the insightful commentary is something I look forward to each week.

Here is what else I've been up to the past two months:

**📺 [Slow Horses (Season 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Horses).** This is a fantastic show and Season 3 is by far the best story thus far. Gary Oldman as a slovenly and rude spymaster is right up my alley. (👍🏻)

**🍿 [The Marvels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvels).** Not much to say about this one. The MCU is still chugging along. I'll continue to watch but I'm less interested for sure. There were good moments in this film and it not being three hours is a huge plus.

**📺 [Invasion (Season 1 and Season 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_(2021_TV_series)).** I was recommended this by my brother. I devoured this show but a month and a half on I'm having trouble remembering much about it. What does that say?

**📖 [The Way Of Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings) by Brandon Sanderson.** I put this book off for way too long. Sanderson is a master and I'm dedicating my year to reading his books. (👍🏻)

**📖 [City in Ruins](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/196968157) by Don Winslow.** I won this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway. It can be done! This is supposedly Don Winslows last book. I enjoyed the series overall but it did not hold a candle to The Power of the Dog trilogy.

**🍿 [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(2021_film)).** Rewatched this in preparation for the sequel. It holds up. The sound design and visuals are nearly as amazing on my couch as they were in the theater. (👍🏻)

**🍿 [Dune: Part 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune:_Part_Two).** This movie is a masterpiece. I'm struggling with what to write about it because I enjoyed every element. The sound design, the visuals, the acting, and the sheer commitment to the Dune vibe makes this a new classic in the Sci-Fi movie pantheon. (👍🏻)

**🕹️ [Persona 3 Reload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_3_Reload).** After playing Midnight Suns I figured I would try my hand at its inspiration. The Persona series games are very long and I've avoided them because of that. No longer. I loved this game and now I'm trying to talk myself off a ledge and diving headfirst into the rest of the franchise. Persona 5 Tactics next?

**🍿 [Alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)) and [Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)).** Classic science fiction at its best.

**🍿 [Poor Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_Things_(film)).** Emma Stone's transformation from baby to adult in this modern Frankenstein was a sight to behold. (👍🏻)

**📖 [Words of Radiance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_of_Radiance) by Brandon Sanderson.** I'm about 75% into the follow up to The Way Of Kings and it's everything the first book was and more. (👍🏻)

**📺 [X-Men ‘97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_%2797).** Love this so far. Can the X-Men reinvigorate the MCU? (👍🏻)

**📺 [Shogun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dgun_(2024_miniseries)).** I'm only two episodes in so far. Reading subtitles is not my cup of tea but the story is very entertaining that I plan on sticking it out.

**🕹️ [Inscryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscryption).** This game combines roguelike deck-building, escape room puzzles, and a creepy setting and comes up with something unlike anything else I've played. Go into this game blind and stick with it. It's worth it. (👍🏻)

The rest of the things I watched / did but weren't worth writing about. Sometimes you just want to watch a little garbage: **🍿 [Next Goal Wins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Goal_Wins_(2023_film))**, **🍿 [Venom: Let There Be Carnage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_Let_There_Be_Carnage).**
