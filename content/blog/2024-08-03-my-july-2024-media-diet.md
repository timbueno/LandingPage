July was a slow, lazy month filled with weddings and coronavirus. I overhauled my computer backup strategy using [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) and [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/). Had my credit card stolen and almost fell victim to an [email scam](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/email-bombing-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf) that I didn't even know existed. Finally, I began work on a new app (üëÄ).

Here is what else I was up to:

**üçø [MaXXXine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaXXXine).** This is probably my least favorite of the trilogy but that's not to say it was bad. There's less of a horror bent than the previous entries and I wanted a bit more spooky.

**üì∫ [Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_20).** I look forward to this every week now. Brennan is an incredible game master and this season is unique in the best way. The Kids On Bikes rule set is perfect for the televised format. I'm also enjoying the week to week progression of Brennan's outfit.

**üçø [MoviePass, MovieCrash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoviePass,_MovieCrash).** More entertaining than I expected. Summer 2017 was a glorious summer in NYC when movies were basically free and everyone I knew had the card. RIP MoviePass. 

**üçø [Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes).** Longer than I wanted it to be. Utterly forgettable but the CGI is quite good.

**üçø [Troll Hunter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trollhunter).** Love me some found footage. I had not watched this in years and it was basically a new experience for me. 

**üçø [Deadpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(film)).** Had not watched this since it was in theaters. Not as entertaining as I remember. It has its moments though.

**üçø [Ferrari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_(2023_film)).** This movie was not what I expected. I think I expected a more racing focused narrative and I was wrong. There were two very surprising moments and I learned quite a bit but it was too slow for me to truly enjoy it.

**üì∫ [Dead Dead Demons Dedede Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Dead_Demon%27s_Dededede_Destruction).** Slice of life anime at the end of the world. This one is still on going. The animation and dub (I know.) are quite good. 

**üìñ [Mirrored Heavens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Earth_and_Sky) by Rebecca Roanhorse.** This book took me quite a while to get into but I think it delivered in the end. I struggled with remembering what had happened in the previous two books. That's a bummer because the world Roanhorse weaved was unlike anything I've read before. I want more fantasy epics set in Pre-Columbian Americas.
