Pretty busy month! I built a gaming PC (which I never expected to do). I've been streaming all my games via Apollo/Artemis to my Odin 2 Portal, and honestly, it's been amazing so far.

We also took a trip to Palm Springs to relax by the pool and made a visit to Joshua Tree National Park—highly recommended.

In between all that, here's what I got into last month:

📖 **[Not Till We Are Lost](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/159116833-not-till-we-are-lost) by Dennis E. Taylor.** The fifth installment in this series. I enjoyed reading/listening to it, but I had a tough time recalling all the history. It also felt like one long setup for future books. Still, I'll keep reading them despite my complaints.

📺 **[Solo Leveling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Leveling).** My favorite anime of the year so far. Gorgeous animation, classic monster-killing action. Hits all the right notes. (👍)

📺 **[The Traitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Traitors_(American_TV_series)).** Somehow both terrible and incredibly entertaining. Don't watch it... unless you're already the kind of person who would.

📺 **[Formula 1: Drive to Survive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive).** Back for its seventh season, and I'm now fully hooked on F1. Can't wait to see how this season plays out.

🕹️ **[Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_%26_Clank:_Rift_Apart).** Beautiful game and fun to play. But the level design could be better—it's so detailed that I occasionally got lost trying to figure out where to go next.

📺 **[Daredevil: Born Again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil:_Born_Again).** I absolutely love Charlie Cox as Daredevil, and his return to the MCU is my favorite thing Marvel has done in a while. More of this, please. (👍)

🍿 **[One of Them Days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_Them_Days).** Irreverent, decently enjoyable buddy comedy. Fun while it lasted, but pretty forgettable a few weeks later.

🕹️ **[Bzzzt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzzzt).** I really like Celeste-style platformers, and this one was a great, quick weekend play. (👍)

📺 **[Pantheon (TV series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(TV_series)).** Gave me strong Three Body Problem vibes. I was completely hooked and found myself racing to the next episode. (👍)

🍿 **[Ghostwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwatch).** Earlier this year, I watched _Late Night with the Devil_, and reviews pointed me to this. It's clear LNWTD took a lot of inspiration from Ghostwatch, which might actually be the better movie. The live-TV-special feel is spot on, and the ending is more subtle but still haunting. (👍)

🕹️ **[God of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(2018_video_game)).** I'm taking my time with this one, and it's paying off. The story is sweet and heartfelt—surprisingly so given the brutal combat. Kratos digging up his old weaponry to save his son is one of the most iconic video game moments I've ever played. (👍)

🕹️ **[Neon White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_White).** A 3D FPS take on Celeste-like gameplay—and maybe my favorite game of the year so far. (👍)

📖 **[We Used to Live Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Used_to_Live_Here) by Marcus Kliewer.** The first half was totally my vibe—serious Alan Wake energy. Unfortunately, I don't think it quite stuck the landing.

📺 **[The Righteous Gemstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Gemstones).** Still love this show. The season premiere was unexpected and incredible. The series is wrapping up soon, so now's a great time to catch up before the finale. (👍)

📺 **[Yakitori: Soldiers of Misfortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakitori:_Soldiers_of_Misfortune).** Watched this anime on a plane. Not super memorable, but still pretty entertaining.

🕹️ **[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night).** I love Metroidvanias, but somehow never played the one that started it all! It's tough, but between generous save points and liberal use of emulator save states, I'm having a blast. (👍)
