Emily and I traveled to Japan in October, and it was an unforgettable experience. We explored Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, and Hakone, immersing ourselves in both the bustling tourist attractions and less-visited gems. Tokyo, in particular, left a lasting impression on us. 

Living in New York City, it's easy to develop a false sense of superiority and city pride, but Tokyo truly has it all. I am very much looking forward to going back one day.

Along the way (and mostly during my 14 hour flights) I did the following:

🕹️ **[Pico Park 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_Park).** Great follow-up to the first game. Have not quite finished it yet, but definitely plan on it the next time our friend group gets together.

📺 **[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power).** I'm writing this a few weeks after the finale and am struggling to really remember much about it. Sauron has some good moments, and the entire season is essential setup for the next season. However, there were just too many storylines, and not all got enough attention and character development that they needed.

🍿 **[The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unbearable_Weight_of_Massive_Talent).** Watched this on a plane and absolutely loved it. Pedro Pascal and Nicolas Cage have surprisingly great chemistry. Highly recommended. (👍)

📺 **[Tulsa King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_King).** I'm watching this half because it's entertaining and half out of morbid curiosity. There are some entertaining aspects to this show, but ultimately I think it's a bit too hokey for its own good.

📺 **[Agatha All Along](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha:_Darkhold_Diaries).** I think this show is good? I can't tell. I do look forward to it each week, and it's done a good job channeling what was good about *Wandavision*.

🍿 **[Face/Off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face/Off).** After watching *The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent* on the plane, I fired up this classic that somehow slipped past me. It's got a slightly strange premise, but the actors really commit to the core conceit of the movie.

🍿 **[Oddity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddity_(film)).** Great horror with a few surprising twists and a satisfying payoff for that anxiety-producing wooden mannequin man. (👍)

📺 **[Only Murders in the Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Murders_in_the_Building).** So many celebrities this season! I think this show is past its prime, but it's still a fun watch. Anything Eugene Levy does makes me smile.

📺 **[Ink Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_Master).** I feel like this show is on season 4000 at this point. This is a guilty pleasure watch if there ever was one.

📖 **[Uzumaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzumaki) by Junji Ito.** I read the graphic novel as I traveled around Japan and thoroughly enjoyed the weird world Ito created here. The recently released anime suffered a lot of criticism for the visuals, but the story held pretty close to the manga. I'll definitely read more Junji Ito after reading this. (👍)

🕹️ **[Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country:_Tropical_Freeze).** I bought this one in Japan at the Tokyo Nintendo Store. I had heard that it was quite difficult and as such I ignored it. It turns out that it is the perfect level for me. It's a step up in difficulty from the Super Mario franchise, and the boss fights are challenging without being annoying. Loving it so far. (👍)

🍿 **['Salem's Lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Salem%27s_Lot_(film)).** The book is one of my favorites in the Stephen King pantheon. This movie was not it, though. The first 30 minutes had me thinking it could be good; the last hour deviated from the book so much that I could barely stay interested.
