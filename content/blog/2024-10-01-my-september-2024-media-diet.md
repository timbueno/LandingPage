The past month saw the release of my new app, [Scoot](https://deadpan.io/scoot/). It is always a humbling experience launching a new app on the App Store with a very limited social media following. Not many downloads at the moment but I think this app is some of my best work to date. I built Scoot for my girlfriend and that will be enough to keep it in development for a while but I really hope other people check it out!

If by some crazy chance you’re reading this and are in the market for (or know someone who might be) a journey tracker similar to Strava, but without all of the social media elements and the pseudo pressure to over perform, give [Scoot](https://deadpan.io/scoot/) a look.

Here's what I've been watching over the top of my MacBook's screen while banging my head against Xcode this path month:

📺 **[Terminator Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_Zero).** Terminator anime with an AI that is humanity’s last defense against SkyNet. I think it’s a pretty great premise and was executed quite well. Looking forward to season 2. (👍)

📺 **[Critical Role: Exandria Unlimited Calamity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exandria_Unlimited).** Brennen Lee Mulligan is an amazing game master but I’m realizing that I like Dimension 20’s lighter, funnier flavor of D&D.

📺 **[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power).** I love The Lord of the Rings. I really do. I’m also really struggling to stay interested in this show and that makes me sad.

🍿 **[Beetlejuice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice).** Still a classic, still entertaining. Nothing like this gets made anymore.

🍿 **[Beetlejuice Beetlejuice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice_2).** Exactly what you think it is. It had a few fun moments, but was filled with modern cinema bloat that made this installment pale in comparison to the lean script that the first movie stuck to.

🍿 **[Sideways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideways).** Saw this one a long time ago and realized I didn’t remember much about it. It’s pretty good and worth your time, tho there’s about 15 minutes that could be cut.

🍿 **[Bottle Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_Shock).** I guess we were on a wine movie kick and didn’t even realize it?

🍿 **[The Watchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watchers_(film)).** Trash. I wanted this to be something that it wasn’t. The reveal of what the watchers were was incredibly underwhelming.

🍿 **[I Saw the TV Glow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Saw_the_TV_Glow).** Man I really wanted to like this one. I really did. I put off watching it for a while because I was going to watch it with a friend but unfortunately that didn’t happen. The soundtrack was good, the message was a little ham fisted.

🍿 **[Watchmen: Chapter I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen_Chapter_I).** Comic book accurate animated version of the same Watchmen story (or half of it anyway) you know and love. Nothing here will surprise you but maybe that’s why it’s enjoyable?

🍿 **[Rebel Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Ridge).** I’m writing this about a week after I watch it and I’m realizing that I don’t remember too much about it other than it was about 30 minutes too long and felt like a spinoff of Jack Reacher.

🕹️ **[Pico Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_Park).** We had a great time playing this with friends on a few occasions. The puzzles are just hard enough that they’re fun but not so hard that someone gets frustrated and has a bad time. Great party game. (👍)

🍿 **[The Crow (2024)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crow_(2024_film)).** Pretty bad as expected.

🍿 **[Cuckoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_(2024_film)).** Oddly enjoyable experience even if Dan Steven’s acting was a little over the top. I would like more horror movies to leave a bit more mystery than they have recently. This has “The Watchers” (see above) vibes, but was better done and more entertaining.

🍿 **[Inside Out 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Out_2).** I could have paid attention to this one a bit harder than I did but from what I did watch, it was good.

📺 **[Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro%27s_Cabinet_of_Curiosities).** Some episodes of this horror anthology are better than others but on the whole this is a good time. I’ve tend to watch a good amount of horror and this scratched that itch.

🍿 **[Dragon Ball Super: Broly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super:_Broly).** Goku and Broly screaming for an hour and a half getting stronger with every scream, as you do.

🕹️ **[Balatro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro_(video_game)).** I'm sure you've heard enough of this app this month already, but it really is that good. Don't skip this one. (👍)
