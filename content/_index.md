# Hi,
# I'm Tim Bueno
{{< /avatar >}}

As an iOS developer in Brooklyn, I create fun apps that solve real-world problems.

This is my little corner of the web, where I share the apps I've built, projects I'm working on, and the media I consume. It's my way of documenting what I've enjoyed and learned along the way.

Want to say hello or have a question? Contact me via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@timbueno) or [email](mailto:hi@timbueno.com).
